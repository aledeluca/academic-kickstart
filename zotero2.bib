property for infinite words, which guarantees good behavior (no lattice structure) in
some related pseudorandom number generators. An infinite word $u$ on a $d$-ary
alphabet has the WDO property if, for each factor $w$ of $u$, positive integer $m$, and
vector $\mathbf v\in\mathbf Z_{m}^{d}$, there is an occurrence of $w$ such that the Parikh
vector of the prefix of $u$ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $\mathbf v$ modulo
$m$. We prove that Sturmian words, and more generally Arnoux-Rauzy words and
some morphic images of them, have the WDO property.},

	abstract = {Episturmian words  are a suitable generalization to arbitrary alphabets of Sturmian words. In this paper we are interested in the problem of enumerating the palindromes in all episturmian words over a $k$-letter alphabet $A_k$. We give a formula for the map $g_k$ giving for any $n$ the number of all palindromes of length $n$ in all episturmian words over $A_k$. This formula extends to $k>2$ a similar result obtained
for  $k=2$ by the second and third author in 2006. The map $g_k$ is expressed in terms
of the map $P_k$ counting for each $n$ the palindromic prefixes of all standard episturmian words
(epicentral words). For any $n\geq 0$, $P_2(n)= \phi(n+2)$ where $\phi$ is the totient Euler function.
The map $P_k$ plays an essential role also in the enumeration formula for the map $\lambda_k$ counting for each $n$ the finite episturmian words over $A_k$. Similarly to Euler's function, the behavior of $P_k$ is  quite irregular. 
 The first values of $P_k$ and of the related maps $g_k$, and $\lambda_k$  for $3\leq k\leq 6$ have been calculated and  reported in  the Appendix.
Some properties of $P_k$ are shown. In particular,   broad upper and  lower bounds for $P_k$, as well as for $\sum_{m=0}^n P_k(m)$ and $g_k$,  are determined. 
Finally, some conjectures concerning the map $P_k$ are formulated.},

One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes $\vartheta$-words with seed as infinite words closed under $\vartheta$ and having at most one left special factor of each length $n\geq N$ (where $N$ is some nonnegative integer depending on the word). When $N=0$ we call such words $\vartheta$-episturmian. Further results on the structure of $\vartheta$-episturmian words are proved.

A $\vartheta$-palindrome reduces to a usual palindrome when $\vartheta$ is the reversal operator. For any word $w\in A^*$ the right (resp. left) $\vartheta$-palindrome closure of $w$ is the shortest $\vartheta$-palindrome having $w$ as a prefix (resp. suffix).
We prove some results relating $\vartheta$-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy, and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word $w$ is Sturmian if and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both the palindromic closures of $w$ share the same minimal period of $w$. A new characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be extended to the episturmian case.
By using the right $\vartheta$-palindrome closure, we extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called $\vartheta$-standard words, which are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols.},

	abstract = {The palindromization map $\psi$ in a free monoid $A^*$ was introduced in 1997 by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet $A$, and later extended  by other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite words, $\psi$ generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard Arnoux-Rauzy words. 
In this paper we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code $X$ over $A$. The new map $\psi_X$  maps $X^*$ to the set $PAL$ of palindromes of $A^*$. In this way some properties of $\psi$ are lost and some are saved in a weak form.
 When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay one can extend $\psi_X$ to 
$X^{\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$ over $A$, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words, called $X$-AR words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper bounds to its factor complexity.  
 
  For any code $X$ we say that $\psi_X$ is conservative when
$\psi_X(X^{*})\subseteq X^{*}$. We study conservative maps $\psi_X$ and conditions on $X$ assuring that $\psi_X$ is conservative. We also investigate the special case of morphic-conservative maps $\psi_{X}$, i.e., maps such that $\varphi\circ \psi = \psi_X\circ \varphi$ for an injective morphism $\varphi$. 
 Finally, we generalize $\psi_X$ by replacing palindromic closure  with $\vartheta$-palindromic closure, where $\vartheta$ is any involutory antimorphism of $A^*$. This yields an extension of the class of
$\vartheta$-standard words introduced by the authors in 2006.},

	abstract = {Central, standard, and Christoffel words are three strongly interrelated classes of binary finite words which represent a finite counterpart to characteristic Sturmian words.
A natural arithmetization of the theory is obtained by representing central
and Christoffel words by irreducible fractions labeling, respectively, two binary trees, the Raney (or Calkin-Wilf) tree and the Stern-Brocot tree.
The sequence of denominators of the fractions in the Raney tree is the famous Stern diatomic numerical sequence. An interpretation of the terms $s(n)$
of Stern's sequence as lengths of Christoffel words when $n$ is odd, and as minimal periods of central words when $n$ is even, allows one to interpret several results on Christoffel and central words in terms of Stern's sequence and, conversely, to obtain new insight into the combinatorics of Christoffel and central words. 
One of our main results is a non-commutative version of the *alternating bit sets theorem* by Calkin and Wilf.
We also study the length distribution of Christoffel words corresponding to nodes of equal height in the tree, obtaining some interesting bounds and inequalities.},

	abstract = {A finite word is closed if it contains a factor that occurs both as a prefix and as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open. 
  We are interested in the oc-sequence of a word, which is the binary sequence whose $n$-th element is $0$ if the prefix of length $n$ of the word is open, or $1$ if it is closed. We exhibit results showing that this sequence is deeply related to the combinatorial and periodic structure of a word. In the case of Sturmian words, we show that these are uniquely determined (up to renaming letters) by their oc-sequence. Moreover, we prove that the class of finite Sturmian words is a maximal element with this property in the class of binary factorial languages. We then discuss several aspects of Sturmian words that can be expressed through this sequence. Finally, we provide a linear-time algorithm that computes the oc-sequence of a finite word, and a linear-time algorithm that reconstructs a finite Sturmian word from its oc-sequence.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study how certain families of aperiodic infinite
words can be used to produce aperiodic pseudorandom number
generators (PRNGs) with good statistical behavior. We introduce
the *well distributed occurrences* (WELLDOC) combinatorial
property for infinite words, which guarantees
absence of the lattice structure defect in related
pseudorandom number generators. An infinite word $u$ on a $d$-ary
alphabet has the WELLDOC property if, for each factor $w$ of $u$,
positive integer $m$, and vector $\mathbf v\in \mathbf Z_{m}^{d}$, there
is an occurrence of $w$ such that the Parikh vector of the prefix
of $u$ preceding such occurrence is congruent to $\mathbf v$
modulo $m$. (The Parikh vector of a finite word $v$ over an alphabet $\mathcal A$ has its $i$-th component equal to the number of occurrences of the $i$-th letter of $\mathcal A$ in $v$.)
We prove that Sturmian words, and more generally
Arnoux-Rauzy words and some morphic images of them, have the WELLDOC
property. Using the TestU01 and
PractRand statistical tests, we moreover show
that not only the lattice structure is absent, but also other
important properties of PRNGs are improved when linear
congruential generators are combined using infinite words having
the WELLDOC property.},

  $\vartheta$-episturmian, where $\vartheta$ is an involutory antimorphism of $A^*$, if
  its set of factors is closed under $\vartheta$ and its left special factors are
  prefixes. When $\vartheta$ is the reversal operator, one obtains the usual
  standard episturmian words.  In this paper, we introduce and study
  $\vartheta$-characteristic morphisms, that is, morphisms which map standard
  episturmian words into standard $\vartheta$-episturmian words. They are a natural
  extension of standard episturmian morphisms. The main result of the paper is
  a characterization of these morphisms when they are injective. In order to
  prove this result, we also introduce and study a class of biprefix codes
  which are *overlap-free*, i.e., any two code words do not overlap
  properly, and *normal*, i.e., no proper suffix (prefix) of any
  code-word is left (right) special in the code.  A further result is that any
  standard $\vartheta$-episturmian word is a morphic image, by an injective
  $\vartheta$-characteristic morphism, of a standard episturmian word.},
