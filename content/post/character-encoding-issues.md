A very old web server is currently forcing me to encode this page using the
Windows-1252 charset instead of the modern standard UTF-8. In addition to making
every tiny change more time-consuming, this also prevents me to display my Czech
colleagues' names properly. My apologies; looking for a way to fix this.
