Last week,
members of the Italian community of researchers in Theoretical Computer Science,
with some notable guests from France and Canada, held a beautiful scientific
event in memory of Aldo de Luca, my former advisor, colleague, and friend
([event homepage in Italian](https://giornateonline.science.blog/)).

Aldo passed
away in October 2018, and we all miss him dearly. His contributions and role in
our community will also be remembered in a dedicated session at the next
[WORDS](http://words2019.lboro.ac.uk/) conference, to be held in Loughborough,
UK on September 9â€“13, 2019.
