    # Scientific Research

    The main areas of my research are theoretical computer science and
    discrete mathematics. In particular, I am interested in *combinatorics
    on words*, the study of structural and algebraic properties of finite
    and infinite strings of symbols. This field has deep connections with
    number theory, physics, biology, and other areas of computer science.

    Sturmian words and generalizations have been the main focus of my
    investigation. Recently, I mostly concentrated on Christoffel words
    with their connection to number theory, and on open vs. closed (aka
    *periodic-like*) prefixes of words, especially in the Sturmian and
    trapezoidal cases . We also found that Sturmian and Arnoux-Rauzy words
    have *well distributed occurrences*, showing how this yields
    statistically valid pseudorandom number generation. In a different line
    of research, we characterized infinite Sturmian words in terms of the
    lexicographic order.

    Previously, I had also focused on rich words, a broad family containing
    (epi-)Sturmian words and their factors, from the point of view of
    periodicity and complexity. Inspired by bioinformatics (Watson-Crick
    involution), we also introduced and studied some different
    generalizations of episturmian words, all based on *special factors* and
    *involutory antimorphisms* of the free monoid. In other papers related
    to episturmian words, we used and expanded the important tool known as
    (iterated) palindromic closure or *palindromization*.

    My first efforts were devoted to finite factors of Sturmian words,
    finding new characterizations (implemented as linear-time algorithms)
    and studying the structure and enumeration of palindromic factors.
