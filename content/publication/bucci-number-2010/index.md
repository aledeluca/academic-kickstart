abstract = """
Episturmian words are a suitable generalization to arbitrary alphabets of
Sturmian words. In this paper we are interested in the problem of enumerating
the palindromes in all episturmian words over a $k$-letter alphabet $A_k$. We
give a formula for the map $g_k$ giving for any $n$ the number of all
palindromes of length $n$ in all episturmian words over $A_k$. This formula
extends to $k>2$ a similar result obtained for $k=2$ by the second and third
author in 2006. The map $g_k$ is expressed in terms of the map $P_k$ counting
for each $n$ the palindromic prefixes of all standard episturmian words
(epicentral words). For any $n\\geq 0$, $P_2(n)=\\varphi (n+2)$ where $\\varphi$
is the totient Euler function. The map $P_k$ plays an essential role also in the
enumeration formula for the map $\\lambda_k$ counting for each $n$ the finite
episturmian words over $A_k$. Similarly to Euler's function, the behavior of
$P_k$ is  quite irregular. The first values of $P_k$ and of the related maps
$g_k$, and $\\lambda_k$ for $3\\leq k\\leq 6$ have been calculated and reported
in the Appendix. Some properties of $P_k$ are shown. In particular, broad upper
and lower bounds for $P\\_k$, as well as for $\\sum\\_{m=0}^n P_k(m)$ and $g_k$,
are determined. Finally, some conjectures concerning the map $P_k$ are
formulated."""
