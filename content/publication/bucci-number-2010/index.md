abstract = """
Episturmian words are a suitable generalization to arbitrary alphabets of
Sturmian words. In this paper we are interested in the problem of enumerating
the palindromes in all episturmian words over a $k$-letter alphabet $A\\_k$. We
give a formula for the map $g\\_k$ giving for any $n$ the number of all
palindromes of length $n$ in all episturmian words over $A\\_k$. This formula
extends to $k>2$ a similar result obtained for $k=2$ by the second and third
author in 2006. The map $g\\_k$ is expressed in terms of the map $P\\_k$ counting
for each $n$ the palindromic prefixes of all standard episturmian words
(epicentral words). For any $n\\geq 0$, $P\\_2(n)=\\varphi (n+2)$ where
$\\varphi$ is the totient Euler function. The map $P\\_k$ plays an essential
role also in the enumeration formula for the map $\\lambda\\_k$ counting for
each $n$ the finite episturmian words over $A\\_k$. Similarly to Euler's
function, the behavior of $P\\_k$ is  quite irregular. The first values of
$P\\_k$ and of the related maps $g\\_k$, and $\\lambda\\_k$ for
$3\\leq k\\leq 6$ have been calculated and reported in the Appendix. Some
properties of $P\\_k$ are shown. In particular, broad upper and lower bounds for
$P\\_k$, as well as for $\\sum\\_{m=0}^n P\\_k(m)$ and $g\\_k$, are determined.
Finally, some conjectures concerning the map $P\\_k$ are formulated."""
