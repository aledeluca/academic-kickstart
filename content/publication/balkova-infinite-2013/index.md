In this paper we introduce the *well distributed occurrences* (WDO)
combinatorial property for infinite words, which guarantees good
behavior (no lattice structure) in some related pseudorandom number
generators. An infinite word $u$ on a $d$-ary alphabet has the WDO
property if, for each factor $w$ of $u$, positive integer $m$, and
vector $\\mathbf v\\in\\mathbb Z_{m}^{d}$, there is an occurrence of $w$
such that the Parikh vector of the prefix of $u$ preceding such
occurrence is congruent to $\\mathbf v$ modulo $m$. We prove that
Sturmian words, and more generally Arnoux-Rauzy words and some morphic
images of them, have the WDO property."""
