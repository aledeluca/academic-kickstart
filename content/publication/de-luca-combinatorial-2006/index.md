We study some structural and combinatorial properties of Sturmian palindromes,
i.e., palindromic finite factors of Sturmian words. In particular, we give a
formula which permits to compute in an exact way the number of Sturmian
palindromes of any length. Moreover, an interesting characterization of Sturmian
palindromes is obtained."""
