 abstract = {We study some structural and combinatorial properties of Sturmian palindromes, i.e., palindromic finite factors of Sturmian words. In particular, we give a formula which permits to compute in an exact way the number of Sturmian palindromes of any length. Moreover, an interesting characterization of Sturmian palindromes is obtained. Â© World Scientific Publishing Company.},
