 abstract = {In this paper we study a class of infinite words on a finite alphabet A whose factors are closed under the image of an involutory antimorphism θ of the free monoid A*. We show that given a recurrent infinite word ω ∈ A\textasciicircumN, if there exists a positive integer K such that for each n ≥ 1 the word ω has (1) card A + (n - 1) K distinct factors of length n, and (2) a unique right and a unique left special factor of length n, then there exists an involutory antimorphism θ of the free monoid A* preserving the set of factors of ω. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
