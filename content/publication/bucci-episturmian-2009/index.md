In this paper we study a class of infinite words on a finite alphabet
$A$ whose factors are closed under the image of an involutory
antimorphism $\\theta$ of the free monoid $A^\\*$.
We show that given a
recurrent infinite word $\\omega \\in A^{\\mathbb N}$, if there exists a
positive integer $K$ such that for each $n\\geq 1$ the word $\\omega$
has

1. $\\mathrm{card} A+(n-1)K$ distinct factors of length $n$, and
2. a unique right and a unique left special factor of length $n$,

then there exists an involutory antimorphism $\\theta$ of the free monoid
$A^\\*$ preserving the set of factors of $\\omega$."""
