abstract = """
In a recent paper with L. Q. Zamboni, the authors introduced the class
of ϑ-*episturmian words*. An infinite word over *A* is
standard ϑ-episturmian, where ϑ is an involutory
antimorphism of *A<sup>*</sup>*, if its set of factors is closed under
ϑ and its left special factors are prefixes. When
ϑ is the reversal operator, one obtains the usual standard
episturmian words.

In this paper, we introduce and study
ϑ-characteristic morphisms, that is, morphisms which map
standard episturmian words into standard ϑ-episturmian words.
They are a natural extension of standard episturmian morphisms. The main
result of the paper is a characterization of these morphisms when they
are injective. In order to prove this result, we also introduce and
study a class of biprefix codes which are *overlap-free*, i.e., any two
code words do not overlap properly, and *normal*, i.e., no proper suffix
(prefix) of any code-word is left (right) special in the code. A further
result is that any standard ϑ-episturmian word is a morphic
image, by an injective ϑ-characteristic morphism, of a
standard episturmian word."""
