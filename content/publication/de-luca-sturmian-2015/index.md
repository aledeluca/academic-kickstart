abstract = """
Central, standard, and Christoffel words are three strongly interrelated classes
of binary finite words which represent a finite counterpart to characteristic
Sturmian words. A natural arithmetization of the theory is obtained by
representing central and Christoffel words by irreducible fractions labeling,
respectively, two binary trees, the Raney (or Calkin-Wilf) tree and the
Stern-Brocot tree. The sequence of denominators of the fractions in the Raney
tree is the famous Stern diatomic numerical sequence. An interpretation of the
terms *s*(*n*) of Stern's sequence as lengths of Christoffel words when *n* is
odd, and as minimal periods of central words when *n* is even, allows one to
interpret several results on Christoffel and central words in terms of Stern's
sequence and, conversely, to obtain new insight into the combinatorics of
Christoffel and central words. One of our main results is a non-commutative
version of the *alternating bit sets theorem* by Calkin and Wilf. We also study
the length distribution of Christoffel words corresponding to nodes of equal
height in the tree, obtaining some interesting bounds and inequalities."""
