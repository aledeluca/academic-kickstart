abstract = """
In this paper we prove that for any infinite word *w* whose set of
factors is closed under reversal, the following conditions are
equivalent:

1.  all complete returns to palindromes are palindromes;

2.  *P* (*n*) + *P* (*n*+1) = *C* (*n*+1) - *C* (*n*) + 2
    for all *n*,

where *P* (resp. *C* ) denotes the palindromic
complexity (resp. factor complexity) function of *w*, which counts the
number of distinct palindromic factors (resp. factors) of each length in
*w*."""
