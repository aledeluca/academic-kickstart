In this paper we prove the following result. Let *s* be an infinite word on
a finite alphabet, and *N* â‰¥ 0 be an integer. Suppose that all left special
factors of *s* longer than *N* are prefixes of *s*, and that *s* has at most one
right special factor of each length greater than *N*. Then *s* is a morphic
image, under an injective morphism, of a suitable standard Arnoux-Rauzy word."""
