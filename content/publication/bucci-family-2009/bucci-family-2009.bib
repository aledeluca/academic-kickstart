 abstract = {In this paper we prove the following result. Let s be an infinite word on a finite alphabet, and N≥0 be an integer. Suppose that all left special factors of s longer than N are prefixes of s, and that s has at most one right special factor of each length greater than N. Then s is a morphic image, under an injective morphism, of a suitable standard Arnoux-Rauzy word. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},
