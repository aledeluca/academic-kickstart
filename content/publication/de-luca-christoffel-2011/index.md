abstract = """
In this note we present some results on the Calkin-Wilf tree of irreducible
fractions, giving an insight on the duality relating it to the Stern-Brocot
tree, and proving noncommutative versions of known results relating labels of
the Calkin Wilf trees to hyperbinary expansions of positive integers. The main
tool is the Christoffel tree introduced in a paper by Berstel and de Luca."""
