We consider involutory antimorphisms ϑ of a free monoid *A*<sup>*</sup> and
their fixed points, called ϑ-palindromes or pseudopalindromes. A ϑ-palindrome
reduces to a usual palindrome when ϑ is the reversal operator. For any word
*w* ∈ *A*<sup>*</sup> the right (resp. left) ϑ-palindrome closure of *w* is the
shortest ϑ-palindrome having *w* as a prefix (resp. suffix). We prove some
results relating ϑ-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy,
and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite
Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word *w* is Sturmian if
and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both
the palindromic closures of *w* share the same minimal period of *w*. A new
characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and
special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be
extended to the episturmian case. By using the right ϑ-palindrome closure, we
extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In
this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called ϑ-standard words, which
are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite
words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols."""
