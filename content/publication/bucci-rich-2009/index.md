abstract = """
In this paper we investigate the periodic structure of rich words (i.e., words
having the highest possible number of palindromic factors), giving new results
relating them with periodic-like words. In particular, some new
characterizations of rich words and rich palindromes are given. We also prove
that a periodic-like word is rich if and only if the square of its fractional
root is also rich."""
