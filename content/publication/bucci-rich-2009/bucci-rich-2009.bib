 abstract = {In this paper we investigate the periodic structure of rich words (i.e., words having the highest possible number of palindromic factors), giving new results relating them with periodic-like words. In particular, some new characterizations of rich words and rich palindromes are given. We also prove that a periodic-like word is rich if and only if the square of its fractional root is also rich.
