abstract = """
Trapezoidal words  are words having at most $n+1$ distinct factors of length $n$
for every $n\\ge 0$. They therefore encompass finite Sturmian words. We give
combinatorial characterizations of trapezoidal words and exhibit a formula for
their enumeration. We then separate trapezoidal words into two disjoint classes:
open and closed. A trapezoidal word is closed if it has a factor that occurs
only as a prefix and as a suffix; otherwise it is open. We investigate open and
closed trapezoidal words, in relation with their special factors. We prove that
Sturmian palindromes are closed trapezoidal words and that a closed trapezoidal
word is a Sturmian palindrome if and only if its longest repeated prefix is a
palindrome. We also define a new class of words, *semicentral words*, and show
that they are characterized by the property that they can be written as $uxyu$,
for a central Sturmian word $u$ and two different letters $x,y$. Finally, we
investigate the prefixes of the Fibonacci word with respect to the property of
being open or closed, and show that the sequence of open and closed prefixes of
the Fibonacci word follows the Fibonacci sequence."""
