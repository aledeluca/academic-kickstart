abstract = """
We study some classes of infinite words that generalize standard episturmian
words, defined by replacing the reversal operator with an arbitrary involutory
antimorphism $\\vartheta$ of $A^*$. An analysis of the relations occurring among
such classes of words, and of the morphisms connecting them to standard
episturmian words, is given. In particular, we analyse some structural
properties of standard $\\vartheta$-episturmian words and their characteristic
morphisms."""
