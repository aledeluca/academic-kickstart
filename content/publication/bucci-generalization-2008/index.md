abstract = "In a recent paper with L. Q. Zamboni the authors introduced the class of v-episturmian words, where v is an involutory antimorphism of the free monoid A*. In this paper, we introduce and study v-characteristic morphisms, that is, morphisms which map standard episturmian words into standard v-episturmian words. They are a natural extension of standard episturmian morphisms. The main result of the paper is a characterization of these morphisms when they are injective.
