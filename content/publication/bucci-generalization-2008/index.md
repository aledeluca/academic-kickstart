In a recent paper with L. Q. Zamboni the authors introduced the class of
ϑ-*episturmian words*, where ϑ is an involutory antimorphism of the free monoid
*A*<sup>*</sup>. In this paper, we introduce and study
ϑ-*characteristic morphisms*, that is, morphisms which map standard episturmian
words into standard ϑ-episturmian words. They are a natural extension of
standard episturmian morphisms. The main result of the paper is a
characterization of these morphisms when they are injective."""
