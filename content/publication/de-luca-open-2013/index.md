A word is closed if it contains a proper factor that occurs both as a prefix and
as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open. We
deal with the sequence of open and closed prefixes of Sturmian words and prove
that this sequence characterizes every finite or infinite Sturmian word up to
isomorphisms of the alphabet. We then characterize the combinatorial structure
of the sequence of open and closed prefixes of standard Sturmian words. We prove
that every standard Sturmian word, after swapping its first letter, can be
written as an infinite product of squares of reversed standard words."""
