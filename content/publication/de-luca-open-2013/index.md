abstract = "A word is closed if it contains a proper factor that occurs both as a prefix and as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open. We deal with the sequence of open and closed prefixes of Sturmian words and prove that this sequence characterizes every finite or infinite Sturmian word up to isomorphisms of the alphabet. We then characterize the combinatorial structure of the sequence of open and closed prefixes of standard Sturmian words. We prove that every standard Sturmian word, after swapping its first letter, can be written as an infinite product of squares of reversed standard words. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
