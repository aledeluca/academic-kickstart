abstract = """
We introduce and study natural derivatives for Christoffel and finite standard
words, as well as for characteristic Sturmian words. These derivatives, which
are realized as inverse images under suitable morphisms, preserve the
aforementioned classes of words. In the case of Christoffel words, the morphisms
involved map *a* to *a*<sup>*k*+1</sup>*b* (resp., *ab<sup>k</sup>*) and *b* to
*a<sup>k</sup>b* (resp., *ab*<sup>*k*+1</sup>) for a suitable *k* > 0. As long
as derivatives are longer than one letter, higher-order derivatives are
naturally obtained. We define the depth of a Christoffel or standard word as the
smallest order for which the derivative is a single letter. We give several
combinatorial and arithmetic descriptions of the depth, and (tight) lower and
upper bounds for it."""
