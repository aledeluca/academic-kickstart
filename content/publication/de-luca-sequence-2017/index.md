abstract = """
A finite word is closed if it contains a factor that occurs both as a prefix and
as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open. We are
interested in the oc-sequence of a word, which is the binary sequence whose
*n*-th element is 0 if the prefix of length *n* of the word is open, or 1 if it
is closed. We exhibit results showing that this sequence is deeply related to
the combinatorial and periodic structure of a word. In the case of Sturmian
words, we show that these are uniquely determined (up to renaming letters) by
their oc-sequence. Moreover, we prove that the class of finite Sturmian words is
a maximal element with this property in the class of binary factorial languages.
We then discuss several aspects of Sturmian words that can be expressed through
this sequence. Finally, we provide a linear-time algorithm that computes the
oc-sequence of a finite word, and a linear-time algorithm that reconstructs a
finite Sturmian word from its oc-sequence."""
