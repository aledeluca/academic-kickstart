abstract = """
In this paper we study some classes of infinite words generalizing episturmian
words, and analyse the relations occurring among such classes. In each case, the
reversal operator $R$ is replaced by an arbitrary involutory antimorphism
$\\vartheta$ of the free monoid $A^*$. In particular, we define the class of
$\\vartheta$-words with seed, whose “standard” elements ($\\vartheta$-standard
words with seed) are constructed by an iterative $\\vartheta$-palindrome
closure process, starting from a finite word $u\\_0$ called the seed. When the
seed is empty, one obtains $\\vartheta$-words; episturmian words are exactly the
$R$-words. One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes
$\\vartheta$-words with seed as infinite words closed under $\\vartheta$ and
having at most one left special factor of each length $n\\geq N$ (where $N$ is
some nonnegative integer depending on the word). When $N=0$ we call such words
$\\vartheta$-episturmian. Further results on the structure of
$\\vartheta$-episturmian words are proved. In particular, some relationships
between $\\vartheta$-words (with or without seed) and $\\vartheta$-episturmian
words are shown."""
