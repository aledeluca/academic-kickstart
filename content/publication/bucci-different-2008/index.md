abstract = """
In this paper we study some classes of infinite words generalizing
episturmian words, and analyse the relations occurring among such
classes. In each case, the reversal operator *R* is replaced by an
arbitrary involutory antimorphism ϑ of the free monoid *A<sup>*</sup>*.
In particular, we define the class of ϑ-words with seed,
whose *standard* elements (ϑ-standard words with seed) are
constructed by an iterative ϑ-palindrome closure process,
starting from a finite word *u<sub>0</sub>* called the seed. When the seed is
empty, one obtains ϑ-words; episturmian words are exactly the
*R*-words.

One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes ϑ-words
with seed as infinite words closed under ϑ and having at most
one left special factor of each length *n* ≥ *N* (where *N* is some
nonnegative integer depending on the word). When *N*=0 we call such
words ϑ-episturmian. Further results on the structure of
ϑ-episturmian words are proved. In particular, some
relationships between ϑ-words (with or without seed) and
ϑ-episturmian words are shown."""
