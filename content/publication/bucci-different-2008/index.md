abstract = "In this paper we study some classes of infinite words generalizing episturmian words, and analyse the relations occurring among such classes. In each case, the reversal operator R is replaced by an arbitrary involutory antimorphism θ of the free monoid A*. In particular, we define the class of θ-words with seed, whose \"standard\" elements (θ-standard words with seed) are constructed by an iterative θ-palindrome closure process, starting from a finite word u0 called the seed. When the seed is empty, one obtains θ-words; episturmian words are exactly the R-words. One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes θ-words with seed as infinite words closed under θ and having at most one left special factor of each length n ≥ N (where N is some nonnegative integer depending on the word). When N = 0 we call such words θ-episturmian. Further results on the structure of θ-episturmian words are proved. In particular, some relationships between θ-words (with or without seed) and θ-episturmian words are shown. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
