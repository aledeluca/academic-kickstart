abstract = """
In this paper we solve some open problems related to (pseudo)palindrome closure
operators and to the infinite words generated by their iteration, that is,
standard episturmian and pseudostandard words. We show that if
$\\vartheta$ is an involutory antimorphism of $A^{\\*}$, then both
$\\vartheta$-palindromic closures of any factor of a $\\vartheta$-standard word
are also factors of some $\\vartheta$-standard word. We also introduce the class
of pseudostandard words with “seed”, obtained by iterated pseudopalindrome
closure starting from a nonempty word. We prove that pseudostandard words with
seed are morphic images of standard episturmian words. Moreover, for any given
pseudostandard word $s$ with seed, there exists an integer $N$ such that for any
$n\\geq N$, $s$ has at most one right (resp. left) special factor of length
$n$."""
