abstract = """
The palindromization map $\\psi$ in a free monoid $A^{\\*}$ was introduced in 1997
by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet $A$, and later extended by
other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite words, $\\psi$
generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard
Arnoux-Rauzy words.
In this paper we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code
$X$ over $A$. The new map $\\psi\\_X$  maps $X^{\\*}$ to the set *PAL* of
palindromes of $A^{\\*}$. In this way some properties of $\\psi$ are lost and some
are saved in a weak form. When $X$ has a finite deciphering delay one can extend
$\\psi\\_X$ to $X^{\\omega}$, generating a class of infinite words much wider
than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code $X$ over $A$, we
give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words, called $X$-AR
words. We prove that any $X$-AR word is a morphic image of a standard
Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper bounds
to its factor complexity.  

For any code $X$ we say that $\\psi\\_X$ is conservative when
$\\psi\\_X(X^{\\*})\\subseteq X^{\\*}$. We study conservative maps $\\psi\\_X$ and
conditions on $X$ assuring that $\\psi\\_X$ is conservative. We also investigate
the special case of morphic-conservative maps $\\psi\\_{X}$, i.e., maps such
that $\\varphi\\circ \\psi = \\psi\\_X\\circ \\varphi$ for an injective morphism
$\\varphi$. Finally, we generalize $\\psi\\_X$ by replacing palindromic closure
with $\\vartheta$-palindromic closure, where $\\vartheta$ is any involutory
antimorphism of $A^{\\*}$. This yields an extension of the class of
$\\vartheta$-standard words introduced by the authors in 2006."""
