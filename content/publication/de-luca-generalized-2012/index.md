abstract = """
The palindromization map *ψ* in a free monoid *A*<sup>*</sup> was
introduced in 1997 by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet *A*, and
later extended by other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite
words, *ψ* generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard
Arnoux-Rauzy words.

In this paper we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code
*X* over *A*. The new map *ψ<sub>X</sub>*  maps *X*<sup>*</sup> to the set *PAL*
of palindromes of *A*<sup>*</sup>. In this way some properties of *ψ* are lost
and some are saved in a weak form. When *X* has a finite deciphering delay one
can extend *ψ<sub>X</sub>* to *X<sup>ω</sup>*, generating a class of infinite
words much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code
*X* over *A*, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words,
called *X*-AR words. We prove that any *X*-AR word is a morphic image of a
standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper
bounds to its factor complexity. For any code *X* we say that *ψ<sub>X</sub>* is
conservative when *ψ<sub>X</sub>* (*X*<sup>*</sup>) ⊆ *X*<sup>*</sup>. We study
conservative maps *ψ<sub>X</sub>* and conditions on *X* assuring that
*ψ<sub>X</sub>* is conservative. We also investigate the special case of
morphic-conservative maps *ψ<sub>X</sub>*, i.e., maps such that
*φ* ∘ *ψ* = *ψ<sub>X</sub>* ∘ *φ* for an injective morphism *φ*. Finally, we
generalize *ψ<sub>X</sub>* by replacing palindromic closure  with ϑ-palindromic
closure, where ϑ is any involutory antimorphism of *A*<sup>*</sup>. This yields
an extension of the class of ϑ-standard words introduced by the authors in
2006."""
