# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = """
Among their many remarkable properties, Christoffel words are known to be linked
to Markov numbers, i.e., positive integer solutions to the equation
$x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$.
We express Markov numbers as coefficients of Christoffel words for a
rational series $S$, defined from a morphism $\\mu$ mapping words to
2x2 integer matrices.

Trying to tackle the long-standing uniqueness conjecture by Frobenius, we study
matrices $\\mu(w)$, where $w$ is a Christoffel word, or just a word $w=aub$ with
$u$ a palindrome, and consider even more general cases leading to
identities for $S$.
We prove some bounds on the entries of such characteristic matrices, and
discuss the special cases $w=a^n b$ and $w=a b^n$ corresponding to Fibonacci
and Pell numbers respectively."""
