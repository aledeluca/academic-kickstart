	abstract = {Episturmian words are a suitable generalization to arbitrary alphabets of Sturmian words. In this paper we are interested in the problem of enumerating the palindromes in all episturmian words over a k-letter alphabet Ak. We give a formula for the map gk giving for any n the number of all palindromes of length n in all episturmian words over Ak. This formula extends to k{\textgreater}2 a similar result obtained for k=2 by the second and third authors in 2006. The map gk is expressed in terms of the map Pk counting for each n the palindromic prefixes of all standard episturmian words (epicentral words). For any n≥0, P2(n)=φ(n+2), where φ is the totient Euler function. The map Pk plays an essential role also in the enumeration formula for the map λk counting for each n the finite episturmian words over Ak. Similarly to Euler's function, the behavior of Pk is quite irregular. The first values of Pk and of the related maps gk, and λk for 3≤k≤6 have been calculated and reported in the paper. Some properties of Pk are shown. In particular, broad upper and lower bounds for Pk, as well as for ∑Pk and gk, are determined. Finally, some conjectures concerning the map Pk are formulated. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we define the class of θ-words with seed, whose "standard" elements (θ-standard words with seed) are constructed by an iterative θ-palindrome closure process, starting from a finite word u0 called the seed. When the seed is empty, one obtains θ-words; episturmian words are exactly the R-words. One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes θ-words with seed as infinite words closed under θ and having at most one left special factor of each length n ≥ N (where N is some nonnegative integer depending on the word). When N = 0 we call such words θ-episturmian. Further results on the structure of θ-episturmian words are proved. In particular, some relationships between θ-words (with or without seed) and θ-episturmian words are shown. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A trapezoidal word is closed if it has a factor that occurs only as a prefix and as a suffix; otherwise it is open. We investigate open and closed trapezoidal words, in relation with their special factors. We prove that Sturmian palindromes are closed trapezoidal words and that a closed trapezoidal word is a Sturmian palindrome if and only if its longest repeated prefix is a palindrome. We also define a new class of words, semicentral words, and show that they are characterized by the property that they can be written as uxyu, for a central word u and two different letters x,y. Finally, we investigate the prefixes of the Fibonacci word with respect to the property of being open or closed trapezoidal words, and show that the sequence of open and closed prefixes of the Fibonacci word follows the Fibonacci sequence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These derivatives, which are defined as inverse images under suitable morphisms, preserve the aforementioned classes of words. In the case of Christoffel words, the morphisms involved map a to a{\textasciicircum}(k+1)b (resp., ab{\textasciicircum}k) and b to a{\textasciicircum}k b (resp., ab{\textasciicircum}(k+1)) for a suitable k{\textgreater}0. As long as derivatives are not just a single letter, higher-order derivatives are naturally obtained. We define the depth of a Christoffel or of a standard word as the smallest order for which the derivative is a single letter. We give several combinatorial and arithmetic descriptions of the depth, and (tight) lower and upper bounds for it. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We consider involutory antimorphisms θ of a free monoid A* and their fixed points, called θ-palindromes or pseudopalindromes. A θ-palindrome reduces to a usual palindrome when θ is the reversal operator. For any word w ∈ A* the right (resp. left) θ-palindrome closure of w is the shortest θ-palindrome having w as a prefix (resp. suffix). We prove some results relating θ-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy, and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word w is Sturmian if and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both the palindromic closures of w share the same minimal period of w. A new characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be extended to the episturmian case. By using the right θ-palindrome closure, we extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called θ-standard words, which are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The palindromization map ψ in a free monoid A* was introduced in 1997 by the first author in the case of a binary alphabet A, and later extended by other authors to arbitrary alphabets. Acting on infinite words, ψ generates the class of standard episturmian words, including standard Arnoux-Rauzy words. In this paper, we generalize the palindromization map, starting with a given code X over A. The new map ψX maps X* to the set PAL of palindromes of A*. In this way, some properties of ψ are lost and some are saved in a weak form. When X has a finite deciphering delay, one can extend ψX to Xω, generating a class of infinite words much wider than standard episturmian words. For a finite and maximal code X over A, we give a suitable generalization of standard Arnoux-Rauzy words, called X-AR words. We prove that any X-AR word is a morphic image of a standard Arnoux-Rauzy word and we determine some suitable linear lower and upper bounds to its factor complexity. For any code X, we say that ψX is conservative when ψX( X*)⊆ X*. We study conservative maps ψX and conditions on X assuring that ψX is conservative. We also investigate the special case of morphic-conservative maps ψX, i.e., maps such that φ°ψ= ψX°φ for an injective morphism φ. Finally, we generalize ψX by replacing palindromic closure with θ-palindromic closure, where θ is any involutory antimorphism of A*. This yields an extension of the class of θ-standard words introduced by the authors in 2006. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Central, standard, and Christoffel words are three strongly interrelated classes of binary finite words which represent a finite counterpart to characteristic Sturmian words. A natural arithmetization of the theory is obtained by representing central and Christoffel words by irreducible fractions labeling, respectively, two binary trees, the Raney (or Calkin-Wilf) tree and the Stern-Brocot tree. The sequence of denominators of the fractions in the Raney tree is the famous Stern diatomic numerical sequence. An interpretation of the terms s(n) of Stern's sequence as lengths of Christoffel words when n is odd, and as minimal periods of central words when n is even, allows one to interpret several results on Christoffel and central words in terms of Stern's sequence and, conversely, to obtain new insight into the combinatorics of Christoffel and central words. One of our main results is a non-commutative version of the "alternating bit sets theorem" by Calkin and Wilf. We also study the length distribution of Christoffel words corresponding to nodes of equal height in the tree, obtaining some interesting bounds and inequalities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A finite word is closed if it contains a factor that occurs both as a prefix and as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open. We are interested in the oc-sequence of a word, which is the binary sequence whose n-th element is 0 if the prefix of length n of the word is open, or 1 if it is closed. We exhibit results showing that this sequence is deeply related to the combinatorial and periodic structure of a word. In the case of Sturmian words, we show that these are uniquely determined (up to renaming letters) by their oc-sequence. Moreover, we prove that the class of finite Sturmian words is a maximal element with this property in the class of binary factorial languages. We then discuss several aspects of Sturmian words that can be expressed through this sequence. Finally, we provide a linear-time algorithm that computes the oc-sequence of a finite word, and a linear-time algorithm that reconstructs a finite Sturmian word from its oc-sequence. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study how certain families of aperiodic infinite words can be used to produce aperiodic pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) with good statistical behavior. We introduce the well distributed occurrences (WELLDOC) combinatorial property for infinite words, which guarantees absence of the lattice structure defect in related pseudorandom number generators. An infinite word u on a d-ary alphabet has the WELLDOC property if, for each factor w of u, positive integer m, and vector v∈Zm{\textasciicircum}d, there is an occurrence of w such that the Parikh vector of the prefix of u preceding such occurrence is congruent to v modulo m. (The Parikh vector of a finite word v over an alphabet A has its i-th component equal to the number of occurrences of the i-th letter of A in v.) We prove that Sturmian words, and more generally Arnoux–Rauzy words and some morphic images of them, have the WELLDOC property. Using the TestU01 and PractRand statistical tests, we moreover show that not only the lattice structure is absent, but also other important properties of PRNGs are improved when linear congruential generators are combined using infinite words having the WELLDOC property. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

An infinite word over A is standard θ-episturmian, where θ is an involutory antimorphism of A*, if its set of factors is closed under θ and its left special factors are prefixes. When θ is the reversal operator, one obtains the usual standard episturmian words. In this paper, we introduce and study θ-characteristic morphisms, that is, morphisms which map standard episturmian words into standard θ-episturmian words. They are a natural extension of standard episturmian morphisms. The main result of the paper is a characterization of these morphisms when they are injective. In order to prove this result, we also introduce and study a class of biprefix codes which are overlap-free, i.e., any two code words do not overlap properly, and normal, i.e., no proper suffix (prefix) of any code-word is left (right) special in the code. A further result is that any standard θ-episturmian word is a morphic image, by an injective θ-characteristic morphism, of a standard episturmian word. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
